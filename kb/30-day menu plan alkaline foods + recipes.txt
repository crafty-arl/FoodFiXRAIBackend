Add variations in vegetables: e.g., roasted eggplant, zucchini noodles, or stuffed peppers with turkey.

Guidelines for Alkaline-Friendly Animal Proteins
Eggs: Choose soft-cooked or poached eggs over fried.
Poultry: Opt for pasture-raised chicken or turkey; use lean cuts like breast meat.
Fish: Wild-caught fish like salmon, cod, trout, and mackerel are less acid-forming. Avoid processed fish.
Pairing: Balance animal proteins with high-alkaline vegetables and herbs like spinach, kale, zucchini, and parsley.
Cooking Methods: Favor grilling, steaming, or baking. Avoid frying in acidic oils.
