Villain 4: Sugar






What It Is:
Here‚Äôs the deal: the Sugar villain is one of the worst when it comes to having a TON of aliases and effects on the body. But what makes him so sneaky is the fact that we actually need him, too. So before we focus on just the bad, let‚Äôs make it more clear what exactly sugar is, and how our body uses it to survive.

Sugar is a type of carbohydrate, a macronutrient that your body uses for energy. It‚Äôs made up of molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The simplest sugars, called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose. When two monosaccharides join together, they form disaccharides, such as sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (milk sugar). Larger carbohydrate molecules like starch are called polysaccharides and are made of many glucose molecules linked together.
How Sugar is Used in the Body for Good
We need sugar, like it or not. Our bodies are fuel engines and some of the power it needs is from energy and fuel that sugars provide. And in the case of sugar, if you don‚Äôt use it, you won‚Äôt necessarily lose it. Sugar does get stored in various forms in our body to be used as an energy source for later. Most easily it is stored in fat cells, which is why eating too much sugar can go straight to fat. Let‚Äôs break this all down a bit‚Ä¶
Energy Source
When you eat sugar, it is broken down in your digestive system into glucose, which enters your bloodstream.
Your body‚Äôs cells absorb glucose with the help of a hormone called insulin, which is made in the pancreas.
Once inside the cells, glucose is used in a process called cellular respiration, where it reacts with oxygen to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency your body uses for everything from thinking to moving your muscles.
Fuel for the Brain
The brain relies on glucose as its main energy source because it doesn‚Äôt store fuel well. This is why having stable blood sugar levels is important for concentration and memory.
Storage for Later
If your body doesn‚Äôt need immediate energy, it stores glucose in the liver and muscles as glycogen. This stored glycogen can be used later when energy demand increases, like during exercise.
Low Glycemic Index Foods
Now what about that thing you hear about called ‚Äúlow glycemic index foods‚Äù ? Let‚Äôs make this little health benefit a lot less confusing, shall we?
Low glycemic index foods are foods that don‚Äôt make your blood sugar go up really fast after you eat them. Like we said, blood sugar is like the energy fuel in your body. Some foods give you a quick boost of energy, but it doesn‚Äôt last long, like eating a lot of candy. Low glycemic foods give you energy more slowly and steadily, so you feel full and energized for a longer time.
These foods are usually healthier for your body because they don‚Äôt make your energy crash later. 
Examples include:
- Fruits like apples, oranges, and berries (but not super sweet ones like watermelon).
- Vegetables like carrots, broccoli, and spinach.
- Whole grains like brown rice, oatmeal, and whole wheat bread.
- Proteins and healthy fats like nuts, seeds, and yogurt.
So basically, low glycemic index foods are great to eat if you want to stay full longer, and keep your energy steady throughout the day!
The Glycemic Index Guide is an excellent resource for a comprehensive list of low glycemic index foods, and can be found at:

Why Sugar Is Bad:
Sugar is extremely acidic. 
A pathogen, or ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù like a bacteria, virus, or cancer cell all thrive in a sugar-rich, acidic environment. Sugar LOVES to feed your sickness starters! This is where your food label superpowers come in handy: the more alkaline you can be, the better for fighting off colds, flus, and killing cancer cells. Don‚Äôt give the Sugar Villain a chance to get past the front door, and choose foods that will alkalize your body and be very low in sugar in the first place.
Now let‚Äôs talk a little about addiction. Did you know that sugar is attracted to the same part of the brain as heroin, and is almost as addictive?
When you eat sugar, it triggers a ‚Äúreward system‚Äù in your brain. This system is designed to make you feel good when you do things necessary for survival, like eating or drinking. 
Here‚Äôs what happens step-by-step:
1. Sugar and Dopamine:
When you eat something sweet, your tongue sends signals to your brain. Your brain releases a chemical called dopamine in an area called the nucleus accumbens. Dopamine is sometimes called the ‚Äúfeel-good chemical‚Äù because it creates a sense of pleasure.
This dopamine release makes you feel happy and reinforces the behavior, encouraging you to eat more sugar.
2. Repetition and Cravings
If you eat sugar often, your brain starts to expect it. Over time, it becomes harder to feel the same level of pleasure from the same amount of sugar. This is called tolerance.
To feel that same ‚Äúsugar high,‚Äù you may need to eat more sugar, just like how people addicted to drugs need more of the drug over time.
3. Brain Pathways
Sugar activates the mesolimbic dopamine system, which is the same brain pathway that drugs like heroin and cocaine stimulate. While sugar is not as strong as these drugs, it still taps into this reward system, which is why it can feel so satisfying and hard to resist.
So, you eat sugar ‚Üí Brain releases dopamine ‚Üí You feel good.
Dopamine levels drop ‚Üí You feel like you need more sugar to feel happy again.
You crave more sugar ‚Üí The cycle repeats.

And the worst part, unlike heroin, sugar is everywhere ‚Äî in drinks, snacks, and meals. This makes it easy to overconsume, leading to health problems like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
Too Much Sugar Overwhelms the System
If you eat more sugar than your body needs, your cells and liver become overwhelmed. Excess glucose is converted into fat and stored in the body, leading to weight gain and potentially fatty liver disease.
Spikes in Blood Sugar
Eating a lot of sugar at once causes a rapid rise in blood sugar levels, triggering the pancreas to release large amounts of insulin. This can lead to a sugar crash, leaving you feeling tired and hungry again soon after.
Over time, constant spikes and crashes can make your cells less responsive to insulin, a condition called insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes.
Inflammation and Cell Damage
Excess sugar in the bloodstream can stick to proteins in your body, forming harmful molecules called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These molecules can damage tissues and contribute to diseases like heart disease and aging of the skin.
Feeding Harmful Bacteria
Sugar can also feed bad bacteria in your mouth, leading to tooth decay.  Even worse, it destroys the good bacteria in your gut, causing all kinds of digestive problems, candida overgrowth, mouth sores, brain fog and disruption of the good gut-brain axis mechanism.

How to Find Sugar in Food: 
The ingredient list (1stü•á),  AND the nutrient portion of the label (second ü•à) need to be examined.  
5 grams.

That‚Äôs all it takes. 5 grams. 
Just as a sense of reference, 1 teaspoon is 4 grams of sugar, so just a little over 1 tsp is what the body needs to make all of its metabolic processes work normally. 
Remember that little fact - it‚Äôs important when looking at food labels! Be sure to choose foods that are 5gm or less. Up to about 11gm is still functional, but the more processed and less natural the sugar is, the worse it gets for your body to handle. 
Here are all of the different kinds of sugar you may see on a label: natural, and artificial. Let‚Äôs start with the most dangerous Villains to recognize and why: the 7 artificial sweeteners.
Most Dangerous Artificial Sweeteners
1. Aspartame

2. Saccharin
Common Uses: Tabletop sweeteners, baked goods, and canned products.
Health Risks
Cancer concerns: Early studies linked saccharin to bladder cancer in animals, though human studies are inconclusive.
Allergic reactions: Some individuals may experience hives, rashes, or breathing difficulties.
Gut disruption: May affect beneficial gut bacteria, potentially leading to metabolic issues.
3. Sucralose (Splenda)
Common Uses: Beverages, baked goods, and sugar-free candies.
Health Risks
Gut microbiome disruption: Reduces beneficial bacteria in the gut, possibly impairing digestive and immune health.
Carcinogenic potential: When heated, sucralose may produce harmful compounds like chloropropanols, which are associated with cancer.
Metabolic effects: May interfere with insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation.
4. Acesulfame Potassium (Ace-K)
Common Uses: Sugar-free beverages, baked goods, and processed foods.
Health Risks
Cancer concerns: Animal studies suggest potential links to cancer, though human evidence is limited.
Metabolic stress: May affect insulin response and glucose metabolism over time.
Artificial taste: Can overstimulate the brain‚Äôs sweet receptors, leading to sugar cravings.
5. Cyclamate (Banned in the U.S. but used in other countries)
Common Uses: Sugar-free syrups, beverages, and candies.
Health Risks
Cancer concerns: Linked to bladder cancer in animal studies, which led to its ban in the U.S.
Endocrine disruption: Possible interference with hormonal balance.
6. Neotame
Common Uses: Low-calorie processed foods, beverages, and desserts.
Health Risks
Toxic byproducts: Contains aspartame derivatives but in much smaller quantities.
Unknown long-term effects: Due to limited independent studies, its safety profile is not well-established.


7. Advantame
Common Uses: Beverages, desserts, and baked goods (newer sweetener, rarely used).
Health Risks
Aspartame derivative: May pose risks similar to aspartame, though effects are generally weaker due to lower doses used.
Minimal research: Limited data on long-term effects.

The Antidote - Balancing The Risks
To balance the risks of eating sugar, incorporate foods that alkalinize the body, and mitigate sugar‚Äôs negative effects on metabolism, gut health, and inflammation. These foods support stable blood sugar levels, optimize digestion, alkalinize and provide the body with nutrients to counteract sugar-related risks.
To scientifically balance the risks of eating sugar, incorporate foods that mitigate sugar‚Äôs negative effects on metabolism, gut health, and inflammation. These foods support stable blood sugar levels, optimize digestion, and provide the body with nutrients to counteract sugar-related risks.

11. Highly Alkaline Foods ‚Äì listed from high to low pH
The pH chart ranges from 1 (highly Acidic) to 14 (highly alkaline /or basic). 
Right in the middle is 7, which = neutral. 

My favorite comprehensive reference list of alkaline vs. acidic foods is from Essense of Life, a nutritional support resource for cancer patients, and can be enjoyed here: https://rense.com/1.mpicons/acidalka.htm
‚ÄúNote that a food‚Äôs acid or alkaline forming tendency in the body has nothing to do with the actual pH of the food itself. For example, lemons are very acidic, however the end products they produce after digestion and assimilation are very alkaline so, lemons are alkaline forming in the body. Likewise, meat will test alkaline before digestion, but it leaves very acidic residue in the body so, like nearly all animal products, meat is very acid forming.‚Äù
The alkalinity of the following foods depends on how they are grown, processed, and prepared. For best results, consume these foods raw, lightly steamed, or minimally cooked to preserve their alkalizing properties.  
Highly Alkaline Foods (pH ~9.0‚Äì8.5)
