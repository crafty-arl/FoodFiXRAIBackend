Cortisol Damage and Reversing with Food
Part 1: The Impact of Cortisol on the Body
Cortisol, a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands, plays a vital role in the body’s stress response, metabolism, and immune function. However, chronic elevation of cortisol can have deleterious effects, including:
Neurodegeneration: Prolonged cortisol exposure can damage hippocampal neurons, impairing memory and learning.
Immune Suppression: Chronic stress suppresses white blood cell activity, increasing susceptibility to infections.
Cardiovascular Strain: Elevated cortisol raises blood pressure and cholesterol, heightening the risk of heart disease.
Metabolic Dysfunction: Persistent cortisol levels can lead to insulin resistance, weight gain (particularly abdominal fat), and type 2 diabetes.
Gut Health Issues: Cortisol disrupts gut barrier integrity, leading to inflammation and conditions like leaky gut syndrome.
Bone Loss: High cortisol levels inhibit bone formation, increasing the risk of osteoporosis.
