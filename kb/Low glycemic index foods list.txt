Low glycemic index foods list
A low glycemic index (GI) diet is an eating plan that focuses on foods with a low GI rating. The goal of such diets is to help people maintain healthy blood sugar levels and reduce their risk for diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems.
The Glycemic Index (GI) measures the impact of carbohydrates on your blood sugar level. Foods are given a number from 0 to 100 based on how quickly they cause your blood sugar to rise after you eat them. Foods with higher GIs can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose while those with lower GIs have less of an effect.
Low GI foods include whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables as well as dairy products like milk and yogurt which all contain fiber or fat that slow digestion time making them more slowly absorbed by the body than high-GI items like white breads or sugary snacks.
When it comes to managing weight loss goals or preventing chronic diseases related to poor nutrition choices, switching out some high-glycemic carbs for healthier options can be beneficial over time because these types of food digest slower so they don’t spike insulin levels as much leading to better control over hunger cravings throughout the day helping keep energy stable instead of having sudden highs followed by lows due fatigue caused by hypoglycemia when sugars drop too fast post meal consumption – this kind of response ultimately affects mood swings negatively too!
Below you will see a chart featuring a complete list for low glycemic index foods compared against their respective GI & GL ratings.
