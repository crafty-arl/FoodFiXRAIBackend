A healthy breakfast option is sliced avocado with cherry tomatoes and fresh basil drizzled with olive oil and lemon. This dish is not only rich in healthy fats, vitamins, and antioxidants but also very easy to prepare. Additionally, overnight oats made with Bobâ€™s Red Mill Organic Oats, almond milk, green bananas, flaxseeds, and a drizzle of raw honey is another fantastic choice. The oats provide fiber and sustained energy, while the bananas add natural sweetness and potassium. These ingredients are often found in grocery stores, making them accessible and convenient for everyday healthful breakfasts.
