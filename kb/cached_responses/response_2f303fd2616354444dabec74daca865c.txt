Soluble fibers with a higher viscosity have shown the greatest and most consistent results at improving blood sugar control, the most studied types being psyllium, guar gum, and beta-glucan. Viscosity refers to the fiber’s ability to form a gel-like substance when mixed with water, which can slow digestion and absorption. 

A set of recent meta-analyses specifically evaluated highly viscous fiber. The first meta-analysis was performed in the context of calorie-restricted diets and included studies on agar, alginate, β-glucan, guar gum, konjac, psyllium, or xanthan. It found a reduction in body weight of 0.74 kg in those consuming these fibers.
