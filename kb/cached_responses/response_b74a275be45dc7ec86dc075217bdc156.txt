A set of recent meta-analyses specifically evaluated highly viscous fiber. The first meta-analysis was performed in the context of calorie-restricted diets and included studies on agar, alginate, Î²-glucan, guar gum, konjac, psyllium, or xanthan. It found a reduction in body weight of 0.74 kg in those consuming these fibers.
