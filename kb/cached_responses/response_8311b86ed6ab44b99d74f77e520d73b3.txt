If you're dealing with a hangover, consider starting your day with a nourishing breakfast of coconut yogurt (like GT's Cocoyo) topped with green bananas, chia seeds, and a sprinkle of cocoa powder for added flavor and antioxidants. For lunch, a refreshing artichoke and parsley salad dressed with roasted garlic and lemon can help recharge your body with vitamins and antioxidants. End your day with a comforting dinner of roasted chicken thighs paired with garlic asparagus, which provides protein and nutrients to aid recovery, alongside a side of Kvass, which may help replenish electrolytes. Happy shopping for these delicious and restorative foods!
