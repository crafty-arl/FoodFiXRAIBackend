Prioritize Healthy Fats like olive oil, avocado, and nuts, which help replace the energy lost from reduced carbohydrates. Healthy fats slow digestion, stabilize blood sugar, and reduce hunger, making them an integral part of a balanced diet. Choose the Right Carbohydrates, including legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, and black beans, as well as vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and carrots, and fruits like apples (with skin), pears, and bananas. Incorporating psyllium husk as a supplement can also be beneficial. The goal should be to identify the diet that works best for long-term maintenance, focusing on a sustainable balance of fats, proteins, and carbs tailored to your lifestyle and metabolism. Enjoy occasional indulgences mindfully without guilt to maintain a healthy relationship with food.
