Comprehensive Guide to Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) 
Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a powerful antioxidant that plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative damage, supporting energy production, and assisting in the regeneration of other antioxidants. It is found in both plant-based and animal-based foods, although animal sources tend to have higher concentrations of ALA compared to plant sources.
