Acid / Alkaline Foods List 

This guide is for those trying to "adjust" their body pH.  The pH scale is from 0 to 14, with numbers below 7 acidic (low on oxygen) and numbers above 7 alkaline.   



Human blood pH should be slightly alkaline (7.35 - 7.45).  Below or above this range means symptoms and disease.  A pH of 7.0 is neutral.  A pH below 7.0 is acidic.  A pH above 7.0 is alkaline.

An acidic body is a sickness magnet.  What you eat and drink will impact where your body's pH level falls.  
An acidic pH can occur from an acid forming diet, emotional stress, toxic overload, and/or immune reactions or any process that deprives the cells of oxygen and other nutrients.  The body will try to compensate for acidic pH by using alkaline minerals.  If the diet does not contain enough minerals to compensate, a buildup of acids in the cells will occur.

An acidic balance will:  decrease the body's ability to absorb minerals and other nutrients, decrease the energy production in the cells, decrease its ability to repair damaged cells, decrease its ability to detoxify heavy metals, make tumor cells thrive, and make it more susceptible to viruses, bacteria, fatigue and illness.  

A blood pH of 6.9, which is only slightly acidic, can induce coma and death.

The reason acidosis is more common in our society is mostly due to the typical American diet, which is far too high in acid producing animal products like meat, eggs and dairy, and far too low in alkaline producing foods like fresh vegetables.  Additionally, we eat acid producing processed foods like white flour and sugar and drink acid producing beverages like coffee and soft drinks.  We use too many drugs, which are acid forming; and we use artificial chemical sweeteners like NutraSweet, Spoonful, Sweet 'N Low, Equal, or Aspartame, which are poison and extremely acid forming.  One of the best things we can do to correct an overly acidic body is to clean up the diet and lifestyle.

To maintain health, the diet should consist of 60% alkaline forming foods and 40% acid forming foods.  

To restore health, the diet should consist of 80% alkaline forming foods and 20% acid forming foods.

Generally, alkaline forming foods include: most fruits, green vegetables, peas, beans, lentils, spices, herbs and seasonings, and seeds and nuts.

Generally, acid forming foods include: meat, fish, poultry, eggs, grains, and legumes.

This chart is intended only as a general guide to alkalizing and acidifying foods.

Table salt (refined), processed vinegar (white), carbonated beverages, processed meats, fried foods, alcohol (low quality beer, liquor), artificial sweeteners, sugary fruit juices, jams, jellies, margarine, processed cheese, and certain refined cereals.

Acid-Forming Junk Foods and Chemicals
Drinks: Cola, beer, sugary coffee, wine (cheap or sugary)
Chemicals: Drugs (medicinal, recreational), herbicides, pesticides, tobacco
Junk Food: Fast food, fried snacks, commercial pickles, processed candies

Notes on Key Foods
Citrus fruits (e.g., lemons, limes): Acidic outside the body but alkalizing after digestion.
Fermented foods (e.g., apple cider vinegar, kombucha, miso): Slightly alkaline-forming.
Animal proteins: Generally acidic, with the highest acidity in processed and red meats.
For optimal pH balance:
80% Alkaline-forming foods (e.g., fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and seeds)
20% Acid-forming foods (e.g., animal products, processed grains, oils, and sweets).
