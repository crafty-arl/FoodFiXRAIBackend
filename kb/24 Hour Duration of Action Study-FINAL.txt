BaselineSalivary Nitrite LevelsOpen label study completed at the University of Virginia examined the duration of action of a single 
serving of "Berkeley Life Nitric Oxide Foundation Capsules”, on salivary and plasma nitrite levels over 24 
hours on 12 healthy participants. Measurements of  salivary and plasma nitrite were taken at baseline, 2, 
4, 8, and 24 hours—the study aimed to understand how long  a single dose supplement could sustain 
elevated salivary nitrite levels.Nitric Oxide Production Over 24 hrsBerkeley Life Foundation Sustains
Wellness begins with better blood flow. berkeleylife.comCorrelation Between Salivary Test Strips and Plasma Nitrite Levels 
The study utilized both laboratory-based plasma and salivary nitrate/nitrite testing, as well as salivary 
test strips to monitor Nitric Oxide levels. While lab testing offers precise quantification, the test strips 
consistently mirrored the trends observed in plasma, validating their utility as a convenient, real-time 
indicator of NO bioavailability.
Berkeley Life Nitric Oxide Foundation Capsules offer a safe, effective, and scientifically validated solution 
for enhancing Nitric Oxide levels, supporting cardiovascular health, and promoting healthy blood flow.  
The correlation between test strip results and plasma nitrite levels provides an accessible, reliable  
method for tracking Nitric Oxide levels in real time.

This study is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Individual results may vary.Clinical Implications for Heart Health  
The sustained elevation of Nitric Oxide levels directly supports cardiovascular health  
by enhancing endothelial function and promoting vasodilation. Previous randomized,  
placebo-controlled trials with Berkeley Life Nitric Oxide Foundation Capsules demonstrated 
significant reductions in blood pressure (BP):
Systolic BP: ↓ 12.5 ± 13.3 mmHg
Diastolic BP: ↓ 4.7 ± 10.3 mmHg
These reductions are clinically meaningful, as a 1 mmHg decrease in systolic BP is associated  
with a 2% reduction in cerebrovascular incident mortality, and a 1 mmHg decrease in diastolic  
BP correlates with a 3% reduction in stroke mortality.
