Common food allergens and additional potential triggers

list of common food allergens and additional potential triggers. These allergens vary in their prevalence and severity, with some being more typical in specific geographic regions and dietary habits.
Major Food Allergens (The “Big 9”)
These are the nine most common allergens that account for the majority of food allergies:
Milk
Commonly includes cow's milk and products derived from it (cheese, yogurt, butter, whey, casein).
Eggs
Includes whole eggs, egg whites, and yolk, as well as powdered egg products often found in processed foods.
Fish
Varieties include cod, salmon, tuna, and other finned fish; may also include fish oils.
Shellfish
Split into crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster) and mollusks (clams, mussels, oysters, scallops).
Tree Nuts
Includes almonds, walnuts, cashews, hazelnuts, pistachios, pecans, macadamia nuts, Brazil nuts.
Peanuts
A legume allergy, though distinct from tree nuts, but often avoided in conjunction with them.
Wheat
Includes wheat flour, whole wheat, and gluten-containing products; common in baked goods, pasta.
Soy
Includes soybeans, soy milk, soy protein, tofu, miso, and soy sauce.
Sesame
Recently added to the major allergen list; includes sesame seeds and sesame oil.
Additional Common and Regional Allergens
These allergens may not be as prevalent globally but can be significant for sensitive individuals.
Corn
Includes corn syrup, cornmeal, corn starch, popcorn, and cornstarch by-products in processed foods.
Gluten
Protein found in wheat, rye, barley, and oats (if cross-contaminated); includes pasta, bread, and cereals.
Mustard

Celery
Can include celery root (celeriac) and celery seed, common in European cuisine.

Buckwheat
Technically a seed, used in gluten-free foods; can trigger cross-reactions with other nuts and seeds.
Fruit Allergies
Common triggers include apples, bananas, citrus fruits, strawberries, melons, kiwi, and mango; associated with oral allergy syndrome.
Vegetable Allergies
Includes tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, peppers, and peas, with sensitivities that vary by individual.
Poultry and Meat Allergies

Sulfites
Commonly found in dried fruits, wine, and some processed foods.
Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)
Commonly used as a flavor enhancer in processed foods and certain cuisines.
Tartrazine (Yellow #5)
A synthetic dye that can cause reactions in sensitive individuals, commonly in candies, soft drinks, and cereals.
Aspartame
An artificial sweetener that may cause reactions in those with phenylketonuria (PKU).
Cross-Reactive Foods
Certain foods can cross-react due to similarities in protein structures.
Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS)
Occurs when individuals allergic to pollen react to certain fruits and vegetables, such as apples (birch pollen), melons (ragweed), and peaches (grass pollen).
Latex-Fruit Syndrome
Individuals allergic to latex may react to foods like bananas, avocados, kiwis, chestnuts, and papayas.
