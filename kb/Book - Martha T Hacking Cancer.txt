Book - Hacking Chemo by Martha Tettenborn
The book Hacking Chemo by Martha Tettenborn presents an integrative approach to managing cancer, particularly during chemotherapy, by leveraging the ketogenic diet, therapeutic fasting, and psychological resilience. Here's a summary of the key scientific concepts discussed in the book:
1. Cancer Metabolism and the Warburg Effect
Cancer cells primarily rely on glucose (sugar) for energy through a process called anaerobic glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. This phenomenon, known as the Warburg effect, highlights the metabolic differences between cancer cells and healthy cells.
Cancer cells struggle to use ketones (produced from fat during fasting or a ketogenic diet) as an energy source, making metabolic therapies like ketogenic diets potentially effective for "starving" cancer cells.
2. Ketogenic Diet as a Metabolic Strategy
A ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate-protein, and very low-carbohydrate diet that shifts the body’s metabolism from glucose to ketones as its primary fuel source.
The diet reduces insulin levels and blood glucose, depriving cancer cells of their preferred energy source, while healthy cells adapt to using ketones for energy.
By lowering inflammation and oxidative stress, the ketogenic diet may also enhance the body’s resilience during cancer treatment.
3. Therapeutic Fasting and Chemotherapy
Fasting before and during chemotherapy may reduce the side effects of treatment and improve its effectiveness:
Stress Response: Short-term fasting induces autophagy (cellular cleanup) and enhances the immune system's ability to target damaged cells.
Chemosensitivity: Healthy cells enter a protective state during fasting, whereas cancer cells become more vulnerable to chemotherapy due to their inability to adapt.
Tettenborn recommends carefully timed fasting (24-72 hours) before chemotherapy sessions, followed by a controlled refeeding period to support recovery.
4. The Role of Inflammation in Cancer Progression
Chronic inflammation can promote cancer growth and metastasis. Both the ketogenic diet and fasting reduce markers of inflammation, creating a less favorable environment for cancer.
By stabilizing blood sugar and lowering insulin levels, these metabolic strategies help mitigate pro-inflammatory pathways linked to cancer progression.
5. Synergy with Conventional Treatments
The book emphasizes that metabolic therapies are complementary to traditional cancer treatments like chemotherapy, not replacements.
A ketogenic diet and fasting may enhance the efficacy of treatments by:
Making cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy.
Protecting healthy cells from chemotherapy’s toxic effects.
Improving overall energy levels and reducing treatment-related fatigue.
6. The Psychological Aspect: "Kickass Attitude"
The book highlights the importance of mindset, resilience, and mental health during cancer treatment.
Positive attitude, stress management techniques, and maintaining a sense of control over one’s health can improve outcomes and quality of life.
Techniques like mindfulness, journaling, and seeking social support are recommended to cope with the emotional toll of cancer.
7. Nutrition and Recovery
The ketogenic diet is rich in healthy fats (avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil) and emphasizes nutrient-dense, whole foods, which are critical for supporting the immune system and overall recovery.
Avoiding sugar, processed foods, and refined carbohydrates is emphasized to maintain metabolic health.
Adequate protein intake is essential for preserving muscle mass during cancer treatment.
8. Scientific Evidence
The author incorporates research from metabolic oncology and emerging studies on ketogenic diets and fasting in cancer care. While much of the evidence is still in preclinical or early clinical stages, she argues that the risk-benefit profile is favorable, especially under medical supervision.
The book stresses the importance of individualization and working closely with healthcare providers when adopting these strategies.
Key Takeaways:
Hacking Chemo advocates using metabolic therapies like the ketogenic diet and fasting to exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer cells while supporting the body’s resilience.
These strategies are not a cure but tools to improve treatment outcomes and quality of life.
Combining dietary interventions with a strong psychological mindset creates a holistic approach to managing cancer.
This book serves as a practical guide for those undergoing cancer treatment who are interested in complementary therapies supported by emerging science.
Here is an expanded list of the scientific research and findings from metabolic oncology and emerging studies on ketogenic diets and fasting in cancer care:

1. The Warburg Effect and Cancer Metabolism
Key Finding: Most cancer cells rely heavily on glucose for energy via aerobic glycolysis, even in oxygen-rich environments, rather than the more efficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
Implications: Because cancer cells are highly dependent on glucose, reducing glucose availability through dietary interventions like the ketogenic diet or fasting can selectively target cancer cells while sparing normal cells.
Study Example: Otto Warburg first described the metabolic shift in cancer cells in the 1920s. Modern research (e.g., Vander Heiden et al., 2009) continues to validate the Warburg Effect as a cornerstone of cancer metabolism.
Relevance: This phenomenon underpins the use of ketogenic diets and fasting to "starve" cancer cells while allowing healthy cells to use ketones.

2. Ketogenic Diet and Cancer Growth
Key Findings:
A ketogenic diet reduces blood glucose levels and insulin, which are critical for the growth of certain cancers.
The low carbohydrate intake forces the body to produce ketones, which cancer cells cannot efficiently metabolize.
Preclinical Studies:
Seyfried et al., 2012: Found that ketogenic diets reduced tumor growth in animal models of glioblastoma.
Zhou et al., 2007: Demonstrated that a ketogenic diet increased survival in mice with malignant gliomas.
Clinical Studies:
Schmidt et al., 2011: A small study on patients with advanced cancer showed that a ketogenic diet was safe and resulted in stable disease in some cases.
Rieger et al., 2014: Patients with glioblastoma on a ketogenic diet alongside standard therapy showed improved outcomes in a small case series.

3. Fasting and Chemotherapy Efficacy
Key Findings:
Fasting prior to chemotherapy enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to the treatment while protecting normal cells.
During fasting, normal cells enter a stress-resistant state, while cancer cells, due to their high metabolic demands, remain vulnerable.
Preclinical Evidence:
Raffaghello et al., 2008: Demonstrated that short-term fasting protected mice from chemotherapy toxicity while enhancing its effectiveness against cancer cells.
Lee et al., 2012: Found that fasting cycles delayed tumor progression in mice and increased survival when combined with chemotherapy.
Clinical Evidence:
Safdie et al., 2009: Preliminary findings in humans showed that fasting reduced chemotherapy-related side effects in cancer patients.
de Groot et al., 2020: A randomized trial showed that fasting-mimicking diets during chemotherapy were feasible and reduced side effects in patients with breast and ovarian cancer.

4. Ketones as an Alternative Energy Source
Key Findings:
Healthy cells can adapt to use ketones as an efficient energy source via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
Cancer cells, due to mitochondrial dysfunction or reliance on glycolysis, are less capable of using ketones.
Research:
Poff et al., 2014: Showed that ketone supplementation in animals slowed the progression of certain cancers, including metastatic cancer.
Maurer et al., 2011: Demonstrated that ketones induced apoptosis (cell death) in cultured cancer cells while sparing healthy cells.

5. Reduced Insulin and IGF-1 Levels
Key Findings:
Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are hormones that promote cell growth and survival, including in cancer cells.
Fasting and ketogenic diets significantly lower insulin and IGF-1 levels, which may inhibit cancer growth.
Studies:
Longo et al., 2010: Demonstrated that fasting reduced IGF-1 levels in mice and sensitized tumors to chemotherapy.
Brandhorst et al., 2015: Found that fasting-mimicking diets in humans reduced IGF-1 levels, suggesting a potential anti-cancer benefit.

6. Ketogenic Diets and Brain Tumors
Key Findings:
Brain tumors like glioblastomas rely heavily on glucose due to the blood-brain barrier limiting access to other energy sources.
Ketogenic diets may provide a metabolic "trap" for these tumors.
Research:
Strowbridge et al., 2010: Found that a ketogenic diet slowed glioblastoma growth in mice.
Meidenbauer et al., 2015: Reported extended survival in glioblastoma patients using a ketogenic diet alongside standard therapy.
Champ et al., 2014: Reviewed the role of ketogenic diets as adjuvant therapies in glioblastoma treatment, showing promising preclinical evidence.

7. Impact on Tumor Microenvironment
Key Findings:
Fasting and ketogenic diets reduce systemic inflammation and alter the tumor microenvironment, making it less conducive to cancer growth.
Tumor hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and acidity, driven by high glucose metabolism, are mitigated by these dietary strategies.
Research:
Hopkins et al., 2015: Found that ketogenic diets reduced markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein, in cancer patients.
Tavernari et al., 2019: Demonstrated that ketogenic diets may improve the tumor immune microenvironment by enhancing T-cell activity.

8. Autophagy and Cellular Cleanup
Key Findings:
Fasting triggers autophagy, a process where cells break down and recycle damaged components, which can help eliminate precancerous or damaged cells.
Cancer cells often resist autophagy, making them more susceptible to damage during fasting-induced stress.
Research:
Madeo et al., 2015: Reviewed the role of fasting in promoting autophagy and its potential in reducing cancer progression.
Degenhardt et al., 2006: Found that defective autophagy in cancer cells led to increased vulnerability to therapeutic stressors.

9. Combination with Immunotherapy
Key Findings:
Ketogenic diets and fasting may enhance the efficacy of emerging cancer immunotherapies by improving immune cell function.
Research:
Di Biase et al., 2016: Showed that fasting improved the efficacy of immunotherapy in mouse models of cancer by enhancing T-cell activity.
Andrejeva & Rathmell, 2017: Highlighted how metabolic interventions could modulate the tumor immune response.

10. Potential Limitations and Challenges
Some cancers, particularly highly glycolytic cancers, may not respond as well to these strategies.
More clinical trials are needed to establish optimal protocols for ketogenic diets and fasting in different cancer types.
Individual patient factors (e.g., weight loss, cachexia, or diabetes) must be considered when implementing these strategies.

Conclusion
The scientific evidence from metabolic oncology supports the ketogenic diet and fasting as promising adjunct therapies for cancer treatment. While preclinical research is robust, clinical studies remain limited, and these interventions should always be supervised by healthcare providers. Their potential lies in targeting cancer metabolism, reducing side effects, and improving quality of life for patients undergoing conventional cancer treatments.
