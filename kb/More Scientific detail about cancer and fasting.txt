Cancer Types:
Breast cancer: 4 patients
Prostate cancer: 2 patients
Ovarian cancer: 1 patient
Uterine cancer: 1 patient
Non-small cell lung carcinoma: 1 patient
Esophageal adenocarcinoma: 1 patient
Fasting Protocols:
Duration Prior to Chemotherapy: Patients fasted for periods ranging from 48 to 140 hours before chemotherapy.
Duration Following Chemotherapy: Fasting continued for 5 to 56 hours post-chemotherapy.
Total Fasting Duration: Combined pre- and post-chemotherapy fasting ranged from approximately 53 to 196 hours.
Chemotherapy Regimens:
Patients received various chemotherapy agents, including:
Docetaxel
Cyclophosphamide
Carboplatin
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)
Paclitaxel
Gemcitabine
The specific combinations and dosages were tailored to each patient's cancer type and clinical condition.
Observed Side Effects:
Fasting-Related: The primary side effects reported due to fasting were hunger and lightheadedness; no significant adverse effects were attributed to the fasting itself.
Chemotherapy-Related:
Among the six patients who experienced chemotherapy both with and without fasting, there was a reported reduction in fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal side effects during the fasting periods.
The severity of side effects was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the National Cancer Institute.
Treatment Outcomes:
Tumor Response: In patients where cancer progression was assessable, fasting did not impede the chemotherapy-induced reduction in tumor size or tumor markers.
Safety and Feasibility: The study suggests that combining fasting with chemotherapy is feasible and safe, with potential to alleviate chemotherapy-induced side effects.
Conclusion:
While this case series indicates that fasting may reduce certain chemotherapy-related side effects without compromising treatment efficacy, the authors emphasize that these findings are preliminary. They advocate for controlled, randomized clinical trials to conclusively determine the impact of fasting on clinical outcomes, including quality of life and therapeutic effectiveness.
