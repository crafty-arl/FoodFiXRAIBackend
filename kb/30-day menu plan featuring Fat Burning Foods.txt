30-day menu plan featuring Fat Burning Foods
Fat-burning foods help the body metabolize stored fat, boost calorie expenditure, and support healthy hormonal balance. They work through the following mechanisms:
Thermogenesis: Foods that increase heat production in the body, burning calories.
Metabolic Boost: Certain compounds increase the rate at which the body burns fat.
Hormonal Support: Foods that regulate hormones such as insulin and leptin, reducing fat storage.
Satiety: High-fiber and protein-rich foods keep you full, reducing overall calorie intake.
Gut Health: Foods rich in prebiotics, probiotics, and fiber promote a healthy gut microbiome, which is linked to better fat metabolism.
