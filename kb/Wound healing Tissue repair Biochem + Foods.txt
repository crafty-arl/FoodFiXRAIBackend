Wound healing & Tissue repair Biochem + Foods

The human body's ability to repair itself from an injury, wound, or surgical procedure involves a complex, highly regulated biological process called tissue repair or wound healing. This process can be divided into four overlapping phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling (maturation). Each phase involves specific cellular and biochemical processes that contribute to tissue repair.

1. Hemostasis Phase: Immediate Response to Injury
The hemostasis phase begins immediately after an injury and focuses on stopping bleeding (hemostasis).
Key Biochemical Events:
Vasoconstriction: Blood vessels constrict to reduce blood flow to the injured site.
Biochemistry: Endothelin, a peptide released by endothelial cells, triggers vasoconstriction.
Platelet Activation and Aggregation: Platelets adhere to exposed collagen in the damaged blood vessel and form a temporary plug.
Biochemistry: Platelet activation is mediated by glycoprotein receptors interacting with von Willebrand factor (vWF). Platelets release granules containing ADP, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 to recruit more platelets.
Clot Formation (Coagulation Cascade): Fibrin, a structural protein, forms a stable clot that seals the wound.
Biochemistry: The coagulation cascade activates thrombin, which converts fibrinogen into fibrin. Calcium and vitamin K are critical cofactors.

2. Inflammatory Phase: Cleaning the Wound
This phase lasts 24–48 hours and involves the recruitment of immune cells to remove debris and pathogens, setting the stage for repair.
Key Biochemical Events:
Vasodilation and Increased Permeability: Injured tissues release pro-inflammatory mediators such as histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins, leading to redness, swelling, and heat.
Biochemistry: Prostaglandins are synthesized via the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway from arachidonic acid.
Recruitment of Immune Cells:
Neutrophils are the first responders and clear pathogens and debris through phagocytosis. They release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteolytic enzymes like elastase and collagenase.
Macrophages replace neutrophils and secrete growth factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-β]) to promote tissue repair.
Cytokine Signaling: Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) amplify the inflammatory response and recruit additional immune cells.

3. Proliferation Phase: Tissue Formation
The proliferation phase begins 2–3 days after injury and can last up to a few weeks. It focuses on rebuilding tissue through the formation of granulation tissue, new blood vessels (angiogenesis), and re-epithelialization.
Key Biochemical Events:
Fibroblast Activation: Fibroblasts migrate into the wound site and produce extracellular matrix (ECM) components like collagen and fibronectin.
Biochemistry: Fibroblast migration is driven by growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and TGF-β.
Angiogenesis (Formation of New Blood Vessels): Endothelial cells form new capillaries to supply oxygen and nutrients to the healing tissue.
Biochemistry: VEGF and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) stimulate endothelial cells to proliferate, migrate, and form tubular structures. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade the basement membrane to allow vessel sprouting.
Keratinocyte Migration and Re-epithelialization: Keratinocytes at the wound edges proliferate and migrate to cover the wound surface.
Biochemistry: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and integrin signaling promote keratinocyte migration.
Collagen Synthesis: Type III collagen, a less organized form, is initially laid down by fibroblasts.

4. Remodeling (Maturation) Phase: Strengthening the Tissue
This phase begins a few weeks after the injury and can last for months or even years. The focus is on remodeling and strengthening the newly formed tissue.
Key Biochemical Events:
Collagen Remodeling: Type III collagen is replaced by the stronger and more organized Type I collagen.
Biochemistry: MMPs break down Type III collagen, while fibroblasts deposit Type I collagen under the influence of TGF-β.
Scar Tissue Formation: Cross-linking of collagen fibers increases tensile strength.
Biochemistry: Lysyl oxidase cross-links collagen fibers using lysine residues, requiring copper as a cofactor.
Capillary Regression: Many newly formed capillaries regress, leaving a less vascularized scar.

Additional Factors Influencing Wound Healing
Nutritional Biochemistry:
Proteins: Required for collagen synthesis and immune function.
Vitamin C: Essential for collagen hydroxylation by prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase.
Zinc: Cofactor for MMPs and DNA synthesis.
Iron: Necessary for hydroxylation reactions and oxygen transport.
Hormonal Regulation:
Glucocorticoids (cortisol) inhibit inflammation and slow wound healing by reducing fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis.
Insulin and growth hormone promote protein synthesis and cell proliferation.
Cellular Senescence: Aging reduces the activity of fibroblasts, macrophages, and keratinocytes, leading to slower healing.

Pathophysiology of Impaired Healing
Chronic Inflammation: Persistent inflammation can lead to excessive collagen deposition (fibrosis) or delayed healing.
Diabetes Mellitus: Hyperglycemia impairs neutrophil and macrophage function, reducing angiogenesis and collagen synthesis.
Infection: Bacterial toxins and biofilms interfere with cell signaling and tissue repair.
Nutrient Deficiencies: Deficiencies in vitamin C, zinc, or protein can impair collagen synthesis and immune responses.

In summary, tissue repair involves intricate biochemical signaling pathways, cellular responses, and nutrient requirements. Understanding these mechanisms can help optimize interventions such as functional medicine, nutritional support, and pharmacological treatments to enhance the healing process.
Here's a comprehensive and detailed list of foods that support repair from injuries, wounds, or surgical procedures. These foods are grouped according to the phases of healing and their biochemical contributions to tissue repair. The explanations include specific nutrients, their mechanisms of action, and why the foods are effective.
