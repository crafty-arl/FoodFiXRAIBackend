The B vitamins that most benefit cellular repair include:
1. Vitamin B3 (Niacin)
Role in Cellular Repair:
Essential for the production of NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide), a coenzyme critical for cellular energy metabolism and DNA repair.
NAD+ activates enzymes like PARPs (Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerases), which repair damaged DNA and maintain genomic stability.
Helps mitigate oxidative stress, a major factor in cellular damage.
Food Sources: Grass-fed beef, chicken, mushrooms, sunflower seeds, quinoa.
2. Vitamin B9 (Folate)
Role in Cellular Repair:
Integral to DNA synthesis and repair, especially during periods of rapid cell division and growth.
Provides methyl groups in the methylation cycle, necessary for proper DNA repair and gene expression.
Food Sources: Lentils, leafy greens (spinach, kale), asparagus, avocado, fortified foods.
3. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)
Role in Cellular Repair:
Works with B9 (Folate) in DNA synthesis and repair.
Critical for the maintenance of the myelin sheath around nerve cells, ensuring proper nerve function and cellular communication.
Food Sources: Eggs, wild-caught fish, organic dairy, and nori (for plant-based options).
4. Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)
Role in Cellular Repair:
Forms Coenzyme A (CoA), vital for the synthesis and repair of cellular membranes.
Important for wound healing and cellular rejuvenation.
Food Sources: Mushrooms, avocados, legumes, whole grains.

Which B Vitamin is Most Critical?
Niacin (B3) is particularly critical for cellular repair due to its role in generating NAD+, which directly supports DNA repair and combats cellular aging. However, B9 (Folate) and B12 are equally important, as they support genetic stability and cell division, particularly for tissues under high regeneration demand.
For optimal cellular repair, a balanced intake of all B vitamins is recommended, as they work synergistically.
