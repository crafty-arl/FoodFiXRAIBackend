Macros /or macronutrient perfect ratios

Best guidelines for excellent diet: 60% of calories per day should be fat (olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil ONLY).  Corn and soy worst ever!!  We become fat from eating carbs and sugar, not from eating fat.  Carbs spike insulin, insulin is a fat storing hormone - it’s like a fat cell fertilizer.  

½ body weight in protein (If weigh 100lbs., eat 50gm protein)
60-70% of diet should be fat, and in the form of olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, grass-fed beef and wild fatty fish.
Only 40-60gm carbs a day (approx 15% total daily intake)
