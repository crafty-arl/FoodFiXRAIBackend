Chicken pasture-raised and organic products
When selecting pasture-raised and organic chicken, it's important to understand the distinctions between various labels to make informed choices. Here's a brief overview:
Organic Chicken: Certified organic chickens are fed 100% organic, non-GMO feed and are not given growth hormones or antibiotics. They must have access to the outdoors, though this doesn't guarantee extensive pasture time.
 Fed By The Farm
Pasture-Raised Chicken: These chickens spend significant time outdoors on pasture, foraging for natural foods like insects and grasses, which can enhance the nutritional profile of the meat. However, the term "pasture-raised" isn't regulated by the USDA, so standards can vary.
