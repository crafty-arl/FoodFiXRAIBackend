Nitric Oxide Foods and Brands
Nitric oxide (NO) is a molecule that helps improve blood flow, regulate blood pressure, and support overall cardiovascular health. While foods don't contain nitric oxide directly, certain foods, especially those rich in nitrates, antioxidants, and amino acids like L-arginine and L-citrulline, help the body produce more nitric oxide.
This is a comprehensive guide that not only details vegan foods high in compounds that support nitric oxide (NO) production, but also includes reputable brands—particularly those that offer USDA Organic, Non-GMO Project Verified, and/or Fair Trade options. Additionally, since you requested it, we’ll include some animal-based options known to contribute to nitric oxide production through their nutrient profiles.
