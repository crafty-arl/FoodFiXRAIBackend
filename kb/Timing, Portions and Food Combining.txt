Timing of Eating, Portions and Food Combining

Timing of eating, portion control, proper food combining and super nutrient saturation will alkalinize the body, decrease inflammation, and help retain weight loss and cellular toxin removal.

Timing of eating					
Pick 3 times to eat, and 1-2 snacks, then eat at only those times (or as close as possible). Consistency is King! Your body prefers a schedule, and the better you stick to it, the faster your results will be seen. Also, Stop EATING 4 Hrs before bed. 

Portion control:					
Follow the 51% rule: make 51% of every meal raw, organic vegetables. 
Also, the 80/20 rule: the stomach is normally only the size of your fist, so eat until you’re 80% full. 
And even more importantly, eat 80% Veggies, 20% protein, with the protein size being that as only the size of the palm of your hand. 
				
								
Food Combining:
Your stomach requires acid to break down heavy proteins and animal fat, and it requires alkaline bile to break down starchy grains. If you have a protein and a starch in the stomach at the same time, the acid pH matches the alkaline pH, and becomes neutralized. As a result, nothing is digested well, and you get bloating, indigestion and fat gain. 					

So as a general rule, here is how food combining should be:
Protein and Veggies is Good   e.g. Fish and cooked,or raw veggies / salad
									
Veggies and Starch is Good 
e.g. Quinoa and veggie stir fry		
					
Protein and Starch is Bad!
e.g. Steak and potatoes, quinoa/brown rice and fish, or burger and fries. 

				
More scientifically stated,

Timing of Eating
The timing of meals plays a crucial role in optimizing metabolic function, energy levels, and digestive health. Adopting a consistent eating schedule aligns with the body's circadian rhythms, which regulate hormones like insulin, cortisol, and ghrelin. Studies have shown that eating meals at consistent times can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome, and support weight loss efforts. Furthermore, ceasing eating at least 4 hours before bed aids in preventing nocturnal acid reflux, improves sleep quality, and allows the digestive system to rest, thereby promoting cellular repair processes.
Additionally, intermittent fasting, where meals are limited to a specific window of time (e.g., 8–12 hours), has been shown to decrease inflammation, enhance mitochondrial function, and stimulate autophagy (cellular cleansing). These mechanisms collectively support toxin removal and promote cellular health.

Portion Control
1. The 51% Rule: Making 51% of meals raw, organic vegetables increases the intake of dietary fiber, antioxidants, enzymes, and water, all of which aid in digestion, reduce oxidative stress, and support gut microbiota diversity. Enzymes in raw vegetables enhance the breakdown of macronutrients, improving nutrient bioavailability. The fiber in vegetables binds to toxins and facilitates their excretion, contributing to cellular detoxification.
2. The 80/20 Rule: Eating until 80% full is based on the Japanese concept of Hara Hachi Bu, which promotes calorie moderation, reduces the risk of overeating, and supports long-term weight maintenance. Overeating stretches the stomach and increases oxidative stress by overloading metabolic pathways. By contrast, stopping at 80% capacity prevents this strain, allows for efficient digestion, and reduces postprandial (after-meal) insulin spikes, thereby stabilizing blood sugar.
3. Food Ratios: Prioritizing 80% vegetables and 20% protein provides a balance of essential nutrients while ensuring a lower glycemic load and higher fiber intake. Protein portions limited to the size of the palm prevent overconsumption, reducing the burden on kidneys and liver while supporting efficient amino acid metabolism. Excess protein, particularly animal-based, can contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress, so moderation is key.

Food Combining
Proper food combining leverages the body’s natural enzymatic and pH-dependent digestive mechanisms to optimize nutrient absorption and prevent gastrointestinal distress.
The Science Behind Protein and Starch Digestion:
Proteins require pepsin and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach for digestion, creating an acidic environment (pH ~2).
Starches, however, begin their digestion in the mouth with salivary amylase and continue in the small intestine in an alkaline environment (pH ~8) supported by bile and pancreatic enzymes.
When proteins and starches are consumed together, the simultaneous release of acidic and alkaline substances neutralizes the stomach’s pH, hindering enzymatic activity. This results in incomplete digestion, leading to fermentation of starches and putrefaction of proteins in the gut. Byproducts of this process, such as gas and toxins, can cause bloating, indigestion, and inflammation.
Food Combining Guidelines:
Protein + Vegetables: Combining proteins with low-carb vegetables optimizes digestion by maintaining a suitable acidic environment in the stomach. For instance, fish and leafy greens provide complementary nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals while promoting smooth digestion.
Starch + Vegetables: This pairing facilitates digestion in the alkaline environment required for starch breakdown, ensuring proper nutrient absorption and gut health. An example is quinoa with vegetables, which provides complex carbohydrates, fiber, and phytonutrients.
Avoid Protein + Starch: Meals like steak and potatoes or rice with fish create digestive inefficiencies. Poor digestion of these meals can lead to the accumulation of undigested food in the gut, promoting inflammation, bacterial overgrowth, and fat storage.

Super Nutrient Saturation and Alkalinization
Incorporating nutrient-dense, alkaline-forming foods (e.g., leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, and sprouts) supports systemic alkalinity, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. A less acidic internal environment has been linked to decreased risk of chronic conditions like arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Super nutrient saturation through diverse whole foods provides essential vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients, supporting cellular energy production, DNA repair, and detoxification pathways (e.g., glutathione synthesis).

Summary of Benefits
By following these principles:
Alkalinization reduces systemic inflammation and chronic disease risk.
Weight loss is supported by portion control, nutrient balance, and stable blood sugar.
Toxin removal is facilitated by high fiber intake, digestive efficiency, and reduced metabolic waste from incomplete digestion.
These holistic strategies create a synergistic effect, optimizing digestion, cellular function, and overall well-being.
